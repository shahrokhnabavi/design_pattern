<h1>Strategy</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Avoid to duplicate code by inherent over and over from interface and overwriting some behavioral.</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm
        vary independently from the clients that use it.
    </li>
    <li>Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury implementation details in derived classes.</li>
    <li>In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time.</li>
</ul>
