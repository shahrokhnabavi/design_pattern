<h1>Facade</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client
    can access the system.</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that
        makes the subsystem easier to use.
    </li>
    <li>Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.</li>
</ul>
