<h1>Singleton</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object. Additionally, lazy initialization and global access are
    necessary.</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.</li>
    <li>Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".</li>
</ul>
