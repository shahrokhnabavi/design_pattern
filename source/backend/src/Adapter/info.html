<h1>Adapter</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. Or in other scenario if we use an external api
    which is time by time it changes.</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that
        couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>Wrap an existing class with a new interface.</li>
    <li>Impedance match an old component to a new system</li>
</ul>
