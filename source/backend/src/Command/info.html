<h1>Command</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the
    request.
</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize clients with different requests, queue or
        log requests, and support undoable operations.</li>
    <li>Promote "invocation of a method on an object" to full object status</li>
    <li>An object-oriented callback</li>
</ul>
