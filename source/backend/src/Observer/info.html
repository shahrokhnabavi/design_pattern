<h1>Observer</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or monitoring requirements are levied.</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are
        notified and updated automatically.
    </li>
    <li>Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or
        user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.</li>
</ul>
