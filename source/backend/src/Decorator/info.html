<h1>Decorator</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>You want to add behavior or state to individual objects at run-time. Inheritance is not feasible because it is static
    and applies to an entire class.<br/>
    A decorator is likely to add functionality (decorate) an object and a strategy is likely to swap functionality.
</p>
<h3>Intent</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
        subclassing for extending functionality.
    </li>
    <li>Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively wrapping it.</li>
    <li>Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.</li>
    <li>You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add
        functionality at run time
    </li>
</ul>
